Step 2: System Architecture Design
        Here’s what we’ll cover:

        1. High-Level Overview
        2. Frontend–Backend Communication
        3. Backend Layers
        4. Authentication Strategy
        5. Data Flow
        6. Infrastructure / Hosting Plan

🔭 1. High-Level Overview
        You’re building a web-based POS system. So your architecture will likely look like this:

        [ Frontend (Next.js 15+) ]
                |
                v
        [ API Gateway / Nginx (optional for SSL + routing) ]
                |
                v
        [ Spring Boot REST API ]
                |
                v
        [ Database (PostgreSQL or MongoDB) ]

        You can also run background jobs, use WebSocket for real-time updates (optional), or include a queue for receipts/logs later.

🔗 2. Frontend–Backend Communication
        Frontend: Next.js 15+ using App Router and fetch()/axios to hit your backend endpoints.

        Backend: Spring Boot exposes RESTful routes:

        POST /auth/login

        GET /products

        POST /sales

        etc.

        Authentication will use JWTs stored in memory or cookies.

🧱 3. Backend Layers (Spring Boot)
        Use the classic layered architecture:

        Controller    ->    Service    ->    Repository
           ↑               (Business      (Data access)
          REST API           logic)

        @RestController handles requests

        @Service contains logic (e.g., discount rules)

        @Repository uses JPA or MongoRepository for DB

🔐 4. Authentication Strategy
        ✅ You're planning to use JWT (JSON Web Tokens):

        POST /auth/login → returns a JWT

        Frontend stores token (in memory or secure cookie)

        Backend uses a JWT filter to verify token on each request

        You can use roles like "ADMIN", "CASHIER" for access control

        Optional bonus: refresh tokens for long sessions.

🔄 5. Data Flow Example (Selling a Product)

        1. User logs in -> gets JWT
        2. Adds items to cart on frontend
        3. Frontend POSTs sale to /api/sales with JWT
        4. Backend:
        - Validates user + inventory
        - Saves Sale + SaleItems
        - Updates inventory
        5. Returns confirmation
        That’s a classic POS workflow. Other flows: managing products, viewing reports, handling returns, etc.

🌐 6. Infrastructure / Hosting Plan
        You already have a mini PC to host the backend API — that’s great!

        Component	Plan
        Frontend (Next.js)	Vercel or Netlify
        Backend (Spring)	Mini PC with Docker + Nginx + SSL
        Database	PostgreSQL or MongoDB on same PC
        Domain & SSL	Free domain + Let’s Encrypt SSL
        Reverse Proxy	Nginx or Caddy
        You can use Docker Compose to run everything locally on your mini PC and port-forward for internet access.

🧠 TL;DR: You Should Decide
        Will you use SQL (JPA) or MongoDB?
        Do you want real-time updates? (e.g., WebSocket for sales activity?)
        Will there be a dashboard/admin view?
